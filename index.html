    <p>My goal is to bring people joy through the content I 
        make. I will achieve this goal by learning from those
        with more experience in my field and by practicing techniques,
        both new and old, as much as I can.<br>

    <p>Hi, my name is William Lacalle, but I prefer to go by Gavin.
        I have a BS in Computer Science with a focus in Game Design 
        that I earned from Southern Arkansas University. Thank you
        for taking a look at my portfolio! As you do, I implore you
        to reach out with any questions you may have. I'll always
        appreciate a good chance to learn something new and
        participate in a conversation. Without further ado, enjoy!
    </p>
